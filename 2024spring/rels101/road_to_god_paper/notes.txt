Final Paper Notes
The Objective
“We ask whether baseball, like Catholicism or Islam or peyote in teh desert, can be a road to God - not the road to God for all, but a road to God for some”

My answer:
The author meets every criteria of a religion in their expression of baseball. We hit upon all the dimensions and achieve a sense of grand wonder. What fails is myself, the reader, who is not transported to a world of the ineffable, who does not experience an emergent sensation of grandeur. The author has, without a doubt, deepened their religious understanding through baseball. The intellectual consideration alone is important to consider for a field that trips over its own toes with definitions. So while baseball can be a road to God for some, it is not a road to God for me.

Ninian Smart Comments
On The Practice and Ritual Dimension
“Every tradition has some practices to which it adheres”

On The Experiential and Emotional Dimension
“It is obvious the emotions and experiences of men and women are the food on which the other dimensions of religion feed”

On The Narrative or Mythic Dimension
“It is typical of all faiths to hand down vital stories: some historical; some about that mysterious primordial time when the world was in its timeless dawn”

The Doctrinal and Philosophical Dimension

The Ethical and Legal Dimension
“The law which a tradition or subtradition incoroporates into its fabric can be called the ethical dimension of religion”

The Social and Institutional Dimension
“Every religious movement is embodied in a group of people, and that is very often rather formally organized”

The Material Dimension
“This social or institutional dimension of religion almost inevitably becomes incarnate in a different way, in material form, as buildings, works of art, and other creations”

Uses of the Seven Dimensions
“Naturally there are religious movements or manifestations where one or other of the dimensions is so weak as to be vritually absent”

Sarah Pike Religion
“The chief lesson of a survey of attempted definitions of religion is that, in religion, practice, feeling, and belief are intertwined, and every definition that would see the ssence of religion in just one of these three facets is too partial”

“The deep need to categorize some religions as normal and others as deviant has distorted both academic study and poular understandings of religion”

Baseball as a road to god
“We prayed before the radio instead of an altar”

“Beyond what is unknown today, there is something that is plainly unknowable, ineffable, no matter how hard we try to figure it out”





**Ninian Smart’s Seven Dimensions of Religion and Baseball**

Ninian Smart's seven dimensions of religion provide a robust framework for analyzing various aspects of religious life, and they can be applied to baseball as argued by John Sexton in "Baseball as a Road to God." Each dimension offers a unique lens through which the religious qualities of baseball can be examined:

1. **Practical and Ritual Dimension**: Baseball is rich with rituals, from the pre-game national anthem and ceremonial first pitch to the repetitive actions of players and fans. These rituals create a sense of order and tradition, much like religious ceremonies do, fostering a shared identity and communal experience among participants.

2. **Experiential and Emotional Dimension**: Fans and players often describe experiencing profound emotions during baseball games—joy, despair, awe, and a sense of transcendence. These intense emotional experiences are akin to religious experiences that connect individuals to something greater than themselves.

3. **Narrative and Mythic Dimension**: Baseball is steeped in stories and legends, from the mythical feats of players like Babe Ruth to the "Curse of the Bambino." These narratives form a mythic structure that gives the sport a historical and cultural depth, much like sacred stories in religious traditions.

4. **Doctrinal and Philosophical Dimension**: Baseball, like religion, has its own set of doctrines and philosophies. The "unwritten rules" of the game, the ethical considerations of sportsmanship, and the strategic thinking involved reflect a deeper philosophical engagement with the sport.

5. **Ethical and Legal Dimension**: The rules of baseball and the moral codes that govern behavior on and off the field mirror the ethical and legal frameworks found in religious traditions. Players and fans adhere to a code of conduct that dictates fair play and respect for the game.

6. **Social and Institutional Dimension**: Baseball is supported by a vast network of institutions, from major league organizations to local little leagues. These institutions provide a social structure that parallels religious congregations, fostering a sense of belonging and community.

7. **Material Dimension**: The physical aspects of baseball—the stadiums, uniforms, and memorabilia—hold significant symbolic value. These material elements create a tangible connection to the sport, similar to religious artifacts and sacred spaces.

Through these seven dimensions, it becomes evident that baseball embodies many characteristics of a religion. Sexton's exploration reveals how the rituals, emotions, stories, doctrines, ethics, institutions, and material culture of baseball contribute to its status as a religious phenomenon, offering a unique perspective on the nature of religion itself.
