# Eclipsing Binary Research
Variable stars make up a significant amount of the stars in the universe and represent a vital area of study in modern astronomy. The light curve (a photometric measure of brightness over a period of time) of a variable star can indicate to astronomers the internal behavior of the star and/or characteristics of its interactions with a binary companion. Measuring a light curve requires a telescope capable of discriminating small changes in magnitude. I present measurements of the light curve of variable star 44 Boötis in which the CWU 0.6m research telescope is sensitive to a 0.2 magnitude change in the visual magnitude, thus confirming the variable nature of the star over its 6.43 hour period.

Disruption of axonal filaments called microtubules (MTs) is posited to be a significant factor in nerve degeneration associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. In the axon, proteins called molecular motors walk along MTs to carry organelles such as mitochondria between the cell body and the axonal terminal. Molecular motors, in turn, apply mechanical forces to MTs that contribute to the organization of MTs in the axon. In healthy developing axons, nearly all MTs are oriented with their fast-growing “plus ends” away from the cell body, referred to as a “plus-end-out” polarity pattern. This uniform polarity pattern is under continual threat of corruption in the face of the nucleation of new MTs and the “flipping” of short MTs into a “minus-end-out” orientation. Here, we present a computational study using agent-based simulations and visual animations to demonstrate how the self-organizing properties of the cytoskeleton contribute to the establishment and maintenance of the MT polarity pattern in axons. We show that minus-end-out MTs can be cleared from the axon through a “polarity sorting” mechanism in which a molecular motor called cytoplasmic dynein slides anti-parallel MTs with their plus-ends leading. We identify conditions under which a simple dynein-based polarity-sorting mechanism is insufficient to prevent MT polarity flaws from accumulating. We demonstrate how flipping and severing events play a complex role in maintaining polarity flaws and are necessary in moderation.

Disruption of axonal microtubule arrays is a key factor in nerve degeneration associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. In developing axons, nearly all MTs are oriented with their plus ends away from the cell body, referred to as a “plus-end-out” polarity pattern. This uniform polarity pattern is under continual threat of corruption in the face of nucleation of new MTs and “flipping” of short MTs into a minus-end-out orientation. Here, we present a computational study using agent-based simulations and visual animations to demonstrate how the self-organizing properties of the cytoskeleton contribute to the establishment and maintenance of the MT polarity pattern in axons. We show that occasional minus-end-out MTs can be cleared from the axon through a “polarity sorting” mechanism in which cytoplasmic dynein slides anti-parallel MTs with their plus-ends leading. We identify conditions under which a simple dynein-based polarity-sorting mechanism is insufficient to prevent MT polarity flaws from accumulating. Our simulations exhibit a positive feedback loop that emerges when mis-oriented MTs grow and incorporate into the MT array, and in turn undermine the efficiency of motor-based polarity-sorting in clearing new minus-end-out MTs from the axon. We hypothesize that a static crosslinking protein, such as TRIM46, which resists relative sliding between parallel MTs plays an essential role in “error prevention” by stabilizing the plus-end-out MT array while allowing dynein-based polarity sorting to remove occasional minus-end-out MTs. We further hypothesize that another static crosslinker, such as PRC1, may boost the efficiency of polarity sorting by aligning anti-parallel MTs to facilitate dynein-based sliding. Initial experiments demonstrate that inhibition of these candidate crosslinking proteins produces an increase in MT polarity flaws in vertebrate axons, in support of our model for a multiple-player polarity-sorting mechanism in the axonal MT array.
