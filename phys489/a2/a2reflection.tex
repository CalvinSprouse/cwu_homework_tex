% reflection prompt
% Select and write a reflection on a graded lab report from one of the upper division physics lab classes that you think best demonstrates the learning outcome of applying experimental methods. Applying experimental methods generally involves applying a multiple component apparatus and/or multiple instruments; applying physical models in the experimental context; developing and applying methods and procedures to achieve an experimental goal; and analyzing, interpreting, and reporting results. Upper division physics lab classes include PHYS 303, 306, 323, 331, 333, 334, 433, 454.

% Scan your selected artifact(s) and combine these into a single PDF document.
% Prepare a 1/2 page reflection on how the artifact demonstrates your progress to meeting this goal.
% Upload both pdf documents to Canvas by 11:59pm Friday, January 26.

% reflection
The artifact I selected is my final lab report for PHYS333 Experimental Physics on the Franck Hertz experiment.
