% Select and write a reflection on a graded artifact (e.g., homework assignment, test, report) from one of the listed elective classes that you think best demonstrates the learning outcome of knowing key physical concepts and applying them to analyze and interpret the behavior of physical systems.
% The artifact you select should be from an elective upper division physics class, such as
% PHYS 301, 303, 304, 322, 323, 334, 410, 433, 441, 454, 475.
% (For students in the Biophysics Specialization, PHYS 322 and 323 are not considered electives.)
Up until this point all my courses have either been required as a physics major with an astronomy minor, or have been non-standard electives such as research credits and teaching courses. This is a placeholder until I receive some feedback from an elective I am currently taking: PHYS 322.
