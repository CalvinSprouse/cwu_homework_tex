% Answer the following question in essay form.  This is not a research paper.  The best answers will be those which combine class lecture notes and the textbook and other readings made available on CANVAS for the course.
% Do the best that you can without plagiarizing others and careful with grammar and spelling.  There are no tricks here. The point is to determine levels of comprehension of readings and lectures (1000 words, double spaced, is probably the minimum it would take to answer properly)

\doublespacing\noindent
It has been argued in class that the creation of the European Union is a post-``Reformation,'' ``Enlightenment'' project. What does this mean and why does this project seem to be faltering leading to a dangerous confusion over what a ``nation,'' and then a ``nation-state,'' should consist of as the basis for geopolitical ``sovereignty?''
\vspace*{1\baselineskip}
