% Answer the following question in essay form.  This is not a research paper.  The best answers will be those which combine class lecture notes and the textbook and other readings made available on CANVAS for the course.
% Do the best that you can without plagiarizing others and careful with grammar and spelling.  There are no tricks here. The point is to determine levels of comprehension of readings and lectures (1500 words, double spaced, is probably the minimum it would take to answer both questions properly)

% In a nutshell, why did I spend so much lecture time on the evolution of Western Civilization (Europe and European-derived) in this course on “World Regions”?
% In a much larger shell, describe in detail the two major phases of Western imperialism (what were Europeans after, what did they find, when and where?) and how each phase impacted different parts of the non-Western World in different ways (use detailed examples); impacts, indeed, that have shaped most of the contemporary characteristics of each “World Region” to this day, as summarized in your textbook.

% in a nutshell...
If one were to take a snapshot of the world in the 1400s and pick out the country most likely to take over the world, they would likely pick China. If one were to repeat this experiment in the 16th century, they might pick Spain or Portugal. Yet, one would be wrong on both accounts. If one were to take a snapshot of the world today, they would not see a global Spanish, Portuguese, or Chinese system. They would instead see a western system of Europe and European derived countries. They would see clear signatures of Europe in the global capitalist trend, the focus on individual military development, and the continual development of democratic systems. So in a nutshell, no other country or system impacted the world in the way Europe would. To understand the world today requires an understanding of how it was developed and the people who developed it.
